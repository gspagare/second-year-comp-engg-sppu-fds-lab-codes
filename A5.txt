# Experiment A5: Write a Python program to compute following operations on String:
#                a) To display word with the longest length
#                b) To determine the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the 
#                   string
#                c) To check whether given string is palindrome or not
#                d) To display index of first appearance of the substring
#                e) To count the occurrences of each word in a given string.
